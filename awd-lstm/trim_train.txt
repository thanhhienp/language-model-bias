 mr. mcgovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of N in october N unless i get fired

 robert l. bernstein chairman and president of random house inc. announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for N years 
 in an interview mr. bernstein said his departure <unk> out of discussions with <unk> newhouse and that 's the decision i reached 
 he declined to elaborate other than to say it just seemed the right thing to do at this minute 
 mr. bernstein said he will stay until dec. N and work with his successor who is to be named soon 
 mr. newhouse meanwhile insisted that he is n't unhappy with mr. bernstein or the performance of random house the largest trade publishing house in the u.s. 
 speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house 
 when ms. evans took her job several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator

 this provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law since a <unk> resolution could be said to be <unk> adopted even though it would require neither <unk> action in congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto 
 president bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to <unk> his duties and exercise his prerogatives 
 if president bush fails to do so in his first year he will <unk> congress for the remainder of his presidency to rewrite article ii of the constitution to suit its purposes 
 if a veto is <unk> because it would leave part of the executive branch <unk> the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and <unk> a power of <unk> declaring the rider restricting his article ii powers to be unconstitutional and <unk> 
 the question is whether his only means of defense is the veto 
 as discussed in the context of controlling federal spending the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to <unk> perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are <unk> merely because they conflict with his policy objectives 
 in that case he might receive an opinion from the court that is a <unk> of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the <unk> thought should be <unk> to the executive 
 if he does not he will help realize madison 's fear in the <unk> no. N of a legislature everywhere extending the <unk> of its activity and drawing all powers into its <unk> <unk>

 in a competitive market this investor has many ways to execute his transactions and he will have more alternatives both foreign and domestic if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle 
 volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage but because his is a large addition or <unk> to a widget market with <unk> liquidity

 mrs. <unk> says she never believed in ghosts before but lately her vacuum cleaner turned itself on a telephone flew off its stand doors <unk> <unk> and she heard <unk> in her empty kitchen 
 i was doing the <unk> and nearly broke my neck running <unk> to see who was there and it was nobody she says eyes wide at the <unk> 
 mr. baker <unk> her out <unk> around a bit asks a few questions and proposes some <unk> 
 of the <unk> vacuum cleaner he says could be <unk> mrs. <unk> 's dog 
 i 'm not sure he 's explained everything mrs. <unk> says <unk> 
 there are some things that have gone on here that nobody can explain she says 
 i tell people it 's the <unk> <unk> of <unk> he says 
 oregon 's mr. hyman has investigated claims of flying <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and has come up with a <unk> explanation he says for every one 
 invariably he says <unk> are <unk> 
 he showed up with a carpenter 's level carefully measured every surface and showed how the apparent <unk> was caused by the perspective 
 a very striking illusion mr. hyman says now his voice <unk> with skepticism but an illusion nevertheless 
 the rev. <unk> <unk> a <unk> professor and <unk> expert at st. <unk> university in <unk> n.y. frequently is asked to <unk> <unk> spirits and he often <unk> 
 on certain occasions a spirit could be <unk> and make itself known he says 
 father <unk> often uses what he calls a <unk> <unk> a few <unk> and an <unk> to the spirit to leave 
 if the person believes there 's an evil spirit you ask it to be gone he says 
 to <unk> with a <unk> in a house owned by a <unk> conn. woman the <unk> recently called in an <unk> the rev. robert <unk> a dissident <unk> who <unk> to the catholic church 's old latin <unk> 
 a scottish <unk> built the small red house N years ago and now his <unk> ghost haunts it mr. warren says

 father <unk> moves through the house <unk> in latin urging the <unk> to split 
 suddenly the woman begins <unk> and then <unk> 
 she 's being attacked by the <unk> mrs. warren <unk> as the <unk> <unk> <unk> water over the <unk> woman and the television camera <unk> 
 a half-hour later the woman is smiling and <unk> the <unk> seems to have gone 
 but mr. warren says the woman has <unk> burns on her back from the confrontation 
 she declines to show them 
 this time though he says i think we got it 
 a.g. edwards & sons runs training classes and looks for experienced brokers 
 he says the department now has N <unk> and wants to hire N civil engineers over the next N months 
 working students she explains want some satisfaction 
 whoever says he knows which of the six will win is out of his mind says antonio <unk> a <unk> member of parliament 
 he came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls probably less because of his vague program to build a new brazil than because of his good looks the open backing of the powerful <unk> <unk> television network and his reputation as a hunter of <unk> or <unk> and <unk> civil <unk> 
 president jose <unk> who took office in N when the man picked by an electoral college became <unk> ill appears to be simply trying to avoid <unk> 
 if brazil <unk> an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt this could lead it to open up and <unk> its <unk> economy analysts say just as <unk> president carlos saul <unk> has been doing even though he was elected on a <unk> platform 
 but his <unk> raises doubts that he would have the political power to carry them out 
 the <unk> mr. <unk> has been vague about his intentions and often <unk> in his rhetoric but analysts say he probably would be <unk> 
 mr. <unk> <unk> a <unk> former factory worker and labor leader is the most radical <unk> to <unk> payments on the foreign debt and saying he would n't go around putting the country up for sale to the highest bidder 
 but despite the differences in what they say according to some analysts here economic constraints mean the next president may not have many choices about what he does 
 this is a change in the social fabric of medicine he says 
 when <unk> <unk> spent several weeks at the medical center of vermont recently with a bone infection in her <unk> she shared a room just like most patients 
 but unlike most patients her <unk> was her husband 
 it was certainly good to have him handy mrs. <unk> says 
 in his letter to knight-ridder president james k. <unk> mr. <unk> said he arrived at the $ N million figure using knight-ridder 's corporate financial statements and comments by knight-ridder officials that the free press has a $ N million value in salvage 
 but in an interview mr. <unk> said he and his investment banker would need access to full financial records before <unk> up the offer 
 but he emphasized that new accounts new sales inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from september 's level 
 he notes that most of the net sales drop stemmed from a <unk> period following the friday the 13th plunge 
 if that follows through next month then it will be a different story he says 
 perhaps he might have cited mr. gorbachev 's need for a stable currency free and competitive markets private property and real prices and other <unk> reforms 
 perhaps he 'd have called for a <unk> political and economic system without a dominant communist party 
 in fact he did the quotes above are from mr. baker 's speech of two weeks ago 
 perhaps mr. gates would <unk> more than mr. baker the many hurdles the soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed 
 but everyone agrees that mr. gorbachev 's problems result from the failure of his own system 
 on the other hand so long as mr. gorbachev is easing his grip on his empire everyone we 've heard agrees that the u.s. can benefit by engaging him 
 so every time a bush official raises a doubt about mr. gorbachev the washington community <unk> cold war and <unk> and an administration spokesman is quickly <unk> out to <unk> mr. bush wants perestroika to succeed 
 mr. baker may want to avoid criticism from senate majority leader george mitchell but as secretary of state his audience is the entire free world not just congress 
 in any case he 's likely to find that the more he <unk> his colleagues the more leaks will pop up all around washington a lesson once learned by henry <unk> 
 we note that in rome yesterday defense secretary cheney said that european euphoria over mr. gorbachev is starting to be <unk> by a recognition of the magnitude of the problems he was trying to deal with 
 the odds are against him as he himself would no doubt tell you 
 the ultimate outcome depends on what he does not on what we do 
 his election increases ryder 's board to N members 
 the ultimate punishment he declared will protect the <unk> from the vicious <unk> individuals who commit these crimes 
 mr. kennedy failed to get his amendment incorporated into last year 's anti-drug legislation and it will be severely attacked on the senate floor this time around 
 vice chancellor maurice a. <unk> iii of delaware 's court of chancery heard arguments for more than two hours here but he made no comment and asked no questions 
 he could rule as early as today on the motion seeking a temporary injunction against the dow jones offer 
 he accused dow jones of using unfair means to obtain the stock at an unfair price 
 he also contended that the plaintiffs failed to cite any legal authority that would justify such an injunction 
 but as judge thomas m. <unk> <unk> his <unk> so he could give final approval the major earthquake struck its epicenter not far from his courtroom in <unk> city calif

 edison brothers stores inc. said it agreed to buy N <unk> women 's apparel stores from <unk> specialty stores corp. a unit of <unk> ltd. of toronto 
 but he said we have too many plants in our system 
 the <unk> plants eventually will have the capacity to build some N million vehicles in the u.s. and that will translate into market share that is going to have to come out of somebody he added 
 he said he feared a revco reorganization might force bondholders to accept a cheap deal and that the bass group 's offer would give them more money 
 in addition revco 's N stores in N states represent a lot of real estate he said and <unk> are helping <unk> the nation 's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs 
 he said he has not met with representatives from acadia 
 they want to <unk> it does n't exist he said 
 demand from japan is expected to continue strong but not from other areas of the world into the first quarter of next year he said 
 outside the u.s. he said producer stocks at the end of august were N tons down N tons from the end of july 
 the colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said president bush sent to colombian president <unk> <unk> and in which president bush said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement 
 last week 's uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety he said but yesterday the market lacked such <unk> 
 there was some profit-taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance he said 
 their only doubt concerned the possibility that mr. gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would <unk> and that the whole process might be reversed 
 if mr. gorbachev 's goal is the creation of a free market he and these western observers have good reason to fear for his future as economic <unk> within communist <unk> leads <unk> to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest 
 yet the soviet leader 's <unk> to <unk> on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power particularly since the last politburo <unk> on sept. N do not suggest that mr. gorbachev is on the verge of being <unk> nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika 
 but is he so <unk> that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run <unk> 
 and has he truly persuaded the communist party to accept economic change of a kind that will sooner or later lead to its demise 
 medical cooperatives among the most successful in the u.s.s.r. are banned from providing <unk> services their main source of income carrying out surgery and treating cancer patients drug <unk> and pregnant women 
 along with some other <unk> indicators these developments suggest that while mr. gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls he is <unk> on creating economic structures of a kind that would <unk> find favor with the <unk> or chicago schools of economic thought 
 he told the congress of people 's deputies on may N we do not share this approach since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country 
 the <unk> of soviet perestroika to the <unk> social blueprint of <unk> was evident when mr. gorbachev presented his economic vision to the soviet congress 
 in doing so he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market 
 instead he proposed a <unk> economy in which there would be a <unk> division between state direction of the economy and economic management 
 at the same time he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed 
 at the same time the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine western-style political <unk> 
 mr. gorbachev would appear to see his central task however as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a <unk> system reach a <unk> 
 if he were able to construct a popular and efficient <unk> system he or his heir would be <unk> to rein in political opposition and to <unk> control in eastern europe 
 the weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations mr. gorbachev is a <unk> political leader perhaps one of the greatest but in its economic prescription 
 contrary to widespread belief <unk> failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time it is doubtful whether <unk> <unk> will make soviet trains run on time or fill the shops with goods that the consumers so desperately <unk>

 a june N article in mother jones magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance 
 for a woman whose period is late using ru-486 means no waiting no walking past picket lines at abortion <unk> and no feet up in <unk> for surgery <unk> health writer <unk> fraser 
 it also means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant 
 thus a woman who used ru-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines an initial visit for medical <unk> <unk> and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated and to take the pill a second trip N hours later for the <unk> <unk> either via injection or <unk> <unk> and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted

 it can be hoped that spanish prime minister <unk> gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory sunday 
 a strong challenge from the far left the communist coalition <unk> <unk> failed to topple him 
 he should consider his victory a mandate to continue his <unk> economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left 
 if he follows the correct path he may be able to look back on this election as the <unk> mark of <unk> opposition 
 mr. gonzalez and his colleagues particularly the finance minister carlos <unk> are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant <unk> who refuse even to go on television controlled by the state to face their <unk> 
 in response to this the socialist prime minister has simply cited his free-market <unk> 
 he did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes 
 now he can go further 
 he should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher not lower revenues

 dr. vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer the second biggest cancer killer in the u.s. after lung cancer 
 he believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple hits on cancer <unk> genes because it often seems to develop in stages 
 his doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a princeton university researcher arnold levine had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into <unk> ones 
 despite that when the johns hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the mr. levine 's p53 gene they found the two were identical it turned out that in mr. levine 's cancer studies he had <unk> been <unk> a damaged form of p53 a <unk> gene 
 the scientists say that since <unk> cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families the gene when inherited in a damaged form may <unk> women to the cancer 
 recently he and others reported that the retinoblastoma <unk> gene may also be involved in some lung cancers as well as several other more common cancers too

 in addition they argue he wo n't help washington 's standing in the region by <unk> the u.s. commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an <unk> role in the failed coup attempt in panama

 mr. arias 's <unk> refusal to support the u.s. 's campaign against leftist nicaragua earned him the <unk> of the reagan white house

 to mr. engelken it is also a story about love because i 'm <unk> to have a wife who still thinks her slightly <unk> husband 's <unk> birthday deserves the ultimate present 
 mr. engelken was doing the same across the hudson river in new jersey where with his nose pressed against the front window of the <unk> national bank he watched the <unk> on a television set the bank set up for the event 
 he wound up and let loose a <unk> 
 there ca n't be an older baseball fan alive who does n't clearly remember that bobby thomson homer who ca n't tell you where he was when he heard the famous <unk> <unk> radio broadcast the one that concluded with mr. <unk> shouting over and over the giants win the <unk> the giants win the <unk>

 mrs. engelken had scheduled a stop on the new jersey turnpike to she told her husband pick up some papers for a neighbor

 his hero signed photographs of the homer and <unk> called ralph <unk> a very fine <unk> 
 and when mr. engelken asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he did n't even know bobby thomson replied you know albert if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy you have an obligation to do it 
 in an interview mr. thomson who is married and has three grown children says he has few ties to baseball these days other than playing <unk> games now and again 
 but his fans to his constant <unk> never let him forget the famous <unk> 
 his mail regularly recalls my one event and has been growing in recent years 
 but when <unk> engelken wrote him saying she could stop near his new jersey home it seemed different 
 what a good feeling it would be for me to do that he says he thought

 at best she <unk> they will rise more slowly more slowly she hopes than her family 's income 
 he said the ordinance also will benefit the <unk> <unk>

 ten years ago the newspaper el espectador of which my brother <unk> was editor began warning of the rise of the drug <unk> and of their leaders ' aspirations to control colombian politics especially the congress

 mr. <unk> is president of el espectador a newspaper founded by his <unk> 
 when the dust and <unk> settle in an <unk> mayoral race the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named david dinkins 
 as the campaign hits the home stretch however voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him 
 the <unk> <unk> manhattan borough president the first black man to win the democratic nomination for mayor here does n't have a single prominent political enemy 
 while he is widely described as a man with deep convictions he has few major political programs that he can call his own 
 asked about his greatest achievement in public life he first speaks about the quality of his staff 
 now as election day <unk> even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the <unk> on nov. N 
 they wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies including union leaders and political <unk> who may seek a place at the trough 
 they wonder whether he has the economic know-how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis and they wonder who will be advising him 
 will he if he wins be in the <unk> of the most liberal of his allies who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that have <unk> money into his campaign 
 after his decisive primary victory over mayor edward i. koch in september mr. dinkins <unk> until recently on a <unk> lead over his republican opponent rudolph giuliani the former crime <unk> who has proved a something of a <unk> as a candidate 
 but mr. dinkins has <unk> in the past two weeks over his campaign 's payments to a black activist who is a convicted <unk> and over his handling of a stock sale to his son 
 polls also have recorded some <unk> in mr. dinkins 's support among jewish voters and <unk> projections now put his lead at between four and N percentage points 
 in an interview with reporters and editors of the wall street journal mr. dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the <unk> 
 a lot of people think i will give away the store but i can assure you i will not he says 
 mr. koch already has announced he will drop N jobs from the city payroll but that wo n't be enough 
 he is going to face a mess says city council president andrew stein 
 his supporters are not <unk> but their solution to everything will be to spend more money and he wo n't have any money 
 by and large mr. dinkins has <unk> the touchy question of whose <unk> he would <unk> 
 he is an <unk> figure who <unk> the <unk> of colleagues ' children opens doors for women and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody 
 more important he emerged as a <unk> last summer after the central park rape of a white <unk> in which a group of <unk> <unk> was charged and the racial murder of a black <unk> in the white brooklyn neighborhood of <unk> 
 rather than scaring off white voters as many predicted he would mr. dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head 
 keeping cool is a dinkins priority on <unk> days this summer he was known to change his <unk> suits as many as four times a day 
 but even in his <unk> campaign he has shown signs of the <unk> and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as manhattan borough president and might <unk> him as mayor 
 over the last few weeks he has <unk> away roughly half of what was once a <unk> lead in the polls over mr. giuliani 
 a story about how he <unk> the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political <unk> <unk> sutton was allowed to <unk> a full week before mr. dinkins faced the media 
 he has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely <unk> to the media until the stock story broke 
 his campaign was caught <unk> amid allegations it paid almost $ N for what it said was a <unk> effort by black activist <unk> carson a convicted <unk> who later said publicly that he is <unk> 
 mr. dinkins also has failed to <unk> jewish voters ' fears about his association with the rev. <unk> jackson despite the fact that few local <unk> politicians have been as <unk> for jewish causes in the past N years as mr. dinkins has 
 but his chance to become deputy mayor under mayor <unk> <unk> a plan boosted by mr. sutton was <unk> because of mr. dinkins 's failure still largely <unk> to file income tax returns for four years running 
 i always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow he said at the time 
 later mr. dinkins became more deeply <unk> to mr. sutton and other city <unk> including <unk> council president paul <unk> when they helped him get appointed city clerk a largely <unk> post responsible for the city 's marriage bureau among other things 
 the debt rose further in N when mr. sutton resigned his position as manhattan borough president to run for mayor 
 david <unk> mayor koch 's longtime media adviser says of mr. dinkins he really is the <unk> of the <unk> system 
 but by most accounts he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's board of estimate the body that votes on crucial budget and <unk> matters 
 colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would <unk> into the early morning hours as mr. dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss en <unk> certain controversial proposals 
 he taught me how to drink <unk> tea instead of coffee at N a.m. i 'll give him that says deputy mayor robert <unk> 
 often mr. dinkins 's <unk> prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out critics claim 
 on the campaign <unk> he often points out that he was the only board of estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at manhattan 's columbus circle 
 but board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided it was too late to try to draw other members to his position 
 he would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster 
 one board member bronx borough president ferdinand <unk> was said to be so <unk> with mr. dinkins 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for mr. dinkins 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign 
 i had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind mr. <unk> admits but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of mr. dinkins and that he backs the democratic candidate <unk> 
 on some occasions when mr. dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign he has run into a familiar kind of trouble 
 he withdrew the remark 
 when he later <unk> with striking hospital workers some allies <unk> a little more concerned that mr. dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees 
 then two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups mr. dinkins promised he would issue a three-year <unk> on construction of <unk> plants 
 while his public statements have at times been confusing mr. dinkins 's position papers have more consistently reflected <unk> sentiment 
 he favors a form of commercial rent control which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city 
 in the midst of a labor shortage he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring new york city residents 
 and he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of new jersey and connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of new york city 
 but mr. dinkins 's economic <unk> do n't seem to bother the business community where he draws significant support 
 steven <unk> president of the real estate board of new york an industry organization says mr. dinkins 's economic development program is <unk> but when it comes down to it he can be reasonable 
 the key man seems to be the campaign manager mr. lynch 
 a <unk> <unk> son of a long island potato farmer mr. lynch is a veteran union <unk> who worked on the presidential campaigns of sen. edward kennedy and mr. jackson 
 but as the dinkins campaign hit tough times this month andrew <unk> the politically <unk> son of the new york governor is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy 
 if she remains influential with mr. dinkins as some suggest she will his <unk> may take on a more <unk> flavor 
 mr. dinkins also has said he would receive economic advice from a board that would include american express co. chairman james d. robinson iii investment banker <unk> <unk> <unk> specialist <unk> lewis and attorney joseph flom

 latin americans see canada as a <unk> power that <unk> their sovereignty he said 
 for example one of my favorite movies is the N british comedy kind hearts and <unk> in which the entire comedy is based on actor dennis price 's <unk> eight titled <unk> all played by <unk> guinness because they <unk> his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title 
 the thin man series of movies as well as many others based their entire <unk> appeal on the star <unk> ' <unk> <unk> and <unk> as other characters in the movies were murdered 
 the specific scene he <unk> in which pet dogs are crushed is somewhat <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> in the old warner <unk> road <unk> <unk> 
 however these <unk> are not the exclusive property of modern <unk> and i believe mr. knight <unk> when he attempts to link this modern phenomenon too closely to a single category of movie making 
 we have n't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to said edgar <unk> jr. du pont 's chairman and chief executive officer in an interview several months before he entered his current position in april 
 a spokesman for seagram the montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the bronfman family said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $ N million a year because of the additional du pont dividends 
 he said du pont holds about N N of the world-wide market the largest single share at a time when growing uses for the <unk> have kept it in tight supply although others are now adding low-cost production capacity 
 a spokesman said <unk> use in some areas of the u.s. was delayed earlier in the year by heavy <unk> thus increasing sales in the third quarter 
 he notes that the marshall plan of u.s. aid to europe did n't just throw money at <unk> europe it also <unk> and opened up those markets 
 he adds that with communism <unk> and mr. gorbachev scrambling to <unk> the soviet economy our interest lies in a controlled <unk> a contained nuclear reaction so we need to help him and not just with words 
 managing change he adds will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the ec especially in dealing with the question of german reunification 
 any push for a gorbachev vision of a common european home <unk> the eventual <unk> of the ec a <unk> partnership and the withdrawal of u.s. forces would be a very very serious problem he says 
 he doubts a <unk> <unk> state will emerge that would dominate europe but warns of a risk of <unk> change in the heart of the european community from a germany that is too strong even if democratic 
 he adds we and the rest of the ec have to talk to the germans now frankly and raise these future risks with them 
 there seems to be a message from moscow there 's a deal on offer he says 
 he adds once both sides feel comfortable it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the east 
 the investor donald a. wright plans to run the company said a spokesman for <unk>

 our bread and butter is still the $ N million to $ N million account he says 
 mr. schwarz 's <unk> founded the new york toy store <unk> schwarz but his family no longer has ties to the company 
 mr. schwarz 's father was a u.s. trust trustee until N 
 he previously held similar responsibilities 
 one of those new computers called <unk> N accounted for nearly half of the N systems sun shipped in the quarter he said 
 mr. <unk> said the issues that hurt sun 's performance earlier this year are now largely behind the firm and he indicated that sun 's profitability should increase throughout the fiscal year 
 mr. rogers who was president and chief operating officer of <unk> will retain his position as president 
 he remains chairman but <unk> little power at the company 
 when he met with mr. bush on his return mr. lee says he told the president that the chinese made statements to me that i regard as a first step toward reconciliation 
 mr. lee says mr. deng told him we should not mind those who participated in demonstrations signed <unk> materials and went on <unk> strikes 
 and he told the <unk> that china 's leaders were very much concerned about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims ' families 
 but he adds i was not acting as a <unk> 
 he says that the chinese never asked him to convey their statements to president bush but that the white house <unk> invited him to do so 
 mr. lee concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in china but attributes that to the fact that the situation in china is very complex 
 but he may not have a choice

 he said that american telephone & telegraph mci communications corp. rochester telephone corp. and ibm itself would likely be digital 's <unk> on the project 
 when we decided to look outside the company for critical <unk> and communications services we wanted to get the best vendor for that service said paul allen the spokesman 
 he said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and somehow he did n't think that was a good thing 
 nicholas brady the incumbent treasury secretary is of course aware of the proposal and he does n't like it much 
 that may have pleased the secretary but h. erich <unk> chief economist of the investment firm of <unk> <unk> & co. suggests that mr. brady may figure he already has all the power he needs 
 he was in fact taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury 
 this recommendation might have encouraged a <unk> bureaucrat to try to expand his power but so far federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job 
 mr. brady has said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago 
 the fed has let interest rates slip slightly but whether the main reason was dollar intervention the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment or the friday N market drop only mr. greenspan and his associates know 
 trying to manage exchange rates to some <unk> level he said would mean <unk> monetary and fiscal policies from their <unk> roles and thereby <unk> excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation 
 the more we think about it the more we suspect mr. brady does indeed have enough power where he already is 
 in fact however mr. reagan 's casual <unk> of the office he so recently held raises issues about which americans can actually do something 
 hungary is no longer a socialist peoples republic the communist party no longer has automatic delegates in the u.s.s.r. 's congress of peoples deputies and egon krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party <unk> when he took over as east germany 's new maximum leader 
 and last but not least president george bush now views the changes in eastern europe as absolutely extraordinary and believes that mr. krenz ca n't turn the <unk> back in east germany because the change is too <unk> as he told the new york times 's <unk> apple jr 
 as one of his defenders so <unk> put it president reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election and some would say thereafter as well 
 he was performing for pay and why should anyone expect anything more 
 the soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government violated <unk> of behavior in afghanistan and just plain <unk> about the radar station 
 you are mad because he 's making so much money say president reagan 's defenders 
 no we ought to be mad because he has <unk> the office we gave him <unk> it in the service of private gain just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth play <unk> games about their activities or to steal a phrase make public service a private trough 
 he was referring to the absolutely extraordinary events in eastern europe and it is a <unk> position 
 we consider that his bid is an acceptable bid said <unk> <unk> spokeswoman for the independent directors ' committee appointed last may to <unk> and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between mr. drabinsky and cineplex 's major shareholder mca inc 
 mca and cineplex 's other major shareholder <unk> financier charles bronfman and his associates have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by mr. drabinsky unless a higher offer is made by another bidder 
 she declined to identify other bidders but said mr. drabinsky 's offer is all cash and it 's for all of the company 
 mr. drabinsky who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years said the purchase subsequently rejected by regulators was aimed at consolidating his control of the company 
 this is being done at the suggestion of mr. drabinsky and to accommodate him to facilitate his financing arrangements ms. <unk> said 
 mr. <unk> said he does n't think messrs. drabinsky and <unk> are anywhere close to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again 
 he said he was surprised by the ec 's reaction calling it <unk> even <unk> 
 mr. hubbard who died in N <unk> the <unk> on his <unk> to his church which licensed them to new era publications a <unk> corporation 
 he distinguished the two cases in salinger judge leval noted the quotations were for the purpose of <unk> the <unk> rather than of proving points about the subject 
 in a powerful separate opinion judge oakes further distinguished the salinger case by pointing out that a living person like mr. salinger had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man like mr. hubbard 
 but in the bare-faced messiah case the author found most of his material in court records or via the freedom of information act 
 if an author quotes more than minimal amounts of unpublished <unk> materials as the salinger decision had it he deserves to be <unk> 
 as a public figure mr. masson had to prove <unk> and as proof of <unk> mr. masson contended that <unk> quotations <unk> to him by ms. malcolm were in fact <unk> 
 the quotes could not be found on the tapes and the two judges who decided the case for ms. malcolm and her publishers conceded that for the purpose of their decision we assume the quotations were deliberately altered 
 in his <unk> dissent judge alex <unk> observed that when a writer uses <unk> marks in reporting what someone has said the reader assumes that these are the speaker 's precise words or at least his words <unk> of <unk> and you know and <unk> error 
 but as judge <unk> noted the context shows that mr. masson 's me alone remark referred not to his alleged <unk> in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else 
 these were only two of a series of <unk> that had in judge <unk> 's words the cumulative effect of making mr. masson appear more arrogant less sensitive <unk> more <unk> and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements 
 but it is not <unk> malcolm who calls him such his own words reveal this psychological profile 
 we now know that the words were not always his own 
 masson has lost his case but the defendants and the profession to which they belong have lost far more 
 the result was a <unk> trial <unk> <unk> cultural conflicts in american life between the smart set whose spokesman was <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> whom <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> 
 few now recall the actual outcome <unk> was convicted and fined $ N and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under tennessee law 
 so it was with the <unk> case a generation later when <unk> <unk> became a <unk> rod for the <unk> of the cold war and <unk> attitudes toward the new deal he had served 
 his trials aroused public <unk> out of all proportion to the rather <unk> secrets he allegedly had passed to soviet intelligence 
 and so it seems to be with the case of elizabeth morgan the washington d.c. plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the <unk> of her daughter 
 dr. morgan has just emerged from the d.c. jail after more than two years ' <unk> for <unk> of court a <unk> to her many supporters 
 but although <unk> did so gently and <unk> many of dr. morgan 's supporters have taken <unk> 's <unk> title the male animal quite literally 
 as members of the black <unk> in congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed dr. morgan does anyone seriously believe that if she were an <unk> black <unk> woman congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill <unk> her 
 or that the president would have <unk> to sign the bill out of <unk> for her plight

 richard breeden had n't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone 
 it was after all only his second full day as chairman of the securities and exchange commission 
 as the stock market <unk> into a 190-point free fall on oct. N mr. breeden found himself <unk> around the sixth floor of the sec from his desk where the new york stock exchange was on an open line to his assistant 's office where the commodity futures trading commission was connected to a third room where a computer monitored market moves 
 with other anxious calls pouring in he recalls i 'd either have to <unk> the new york stock exchange or go out to the secretary 's desk 
 now there are more lines connected to the chairman 's office and the <unk> computer has been moved next to his desk 
 like his predecessor david <unk> he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office 
 but unlike mr. <unk> who during the N crash damaged himself by saying rather <unk> that the markets might be closed mr. breeden is turning the market drop to his own advantage using it to further his agenda for the sec 
 in an interview and in congressional testimony he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average the second-largest ever as evidence of the need for congress to give the sec the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market 
 more broadly he wants to modernize regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping u.s. financial firms compete in the global market 
 he believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs an area the sec does n't regulate directly but one where it <unk> influence both on wall street and in congress 
 also unlike mr. <unk> mr. breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda 
 as a former white house aide who worked closely with congress he is <unk> in the ways of washington 
 what 's more the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own majority on the <unk> commission enabling him to avoid the <unk> that frustrated his predecessor 
 for instance he has n't stated a clear position on high-risk high-yield junk bonds an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market <unk> over into stocks 
 he may be waiting to see the results of several pending sec studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules 
 he also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission a job vacant since the summer 
 mr. breeden 's selection will be <unk> as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the sec 's <unk> pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on wall street 
 congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while 
 indeed during mr. breeden 's confirmation hearing last month senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times more often than they asked about his <unk> for the job 
 these days mr. breeden is winning <unk> in washington and on wall street for his <unk> role in monitoring the friday-the-13th market plunge and the following monday 's <unk> morning session 
 they note that he has <unk> his office with five photos of george bush one of them featuring the first dog <unk> 
 but mr. breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the sec his way 
 during the monday market rebound a new york exchange spokesman told cable news network viewers that the industrial average had turned down N points 
 stunned mr. breeden turned to his <unk> computer which by then was next to his desk 
 it was the plunge that did n't happen he says 
 mr. breeden not missing a chance to press his agenda cited the earthquake

 federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told congress that the fed can wipe out inflation without causing a recession but he said doing so will <unk> some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply 
 mr. greenspan said he and other fed governors <unk> a bill by rep. stephen neal d. n.c. that would require the fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years 
 what seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics he said 
 he did n't elaborate 
 he warned that fed efforts to <unk> inflation would fail and could produce a major financial crunch unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit which causes the government to borrow heavily 
 he altered the <unk> to win mr. greenspan 's endorsement 
 even so his bill is given little chance of passage 
 mr. greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise <unk> in the tax reform act of N and result in higher marginal income tax rates

 but when the two men met in new york a day after mr. icahn disclosed the rise in his usx stake mr. corry learned that mr. icahn wanted him to sell all of texas oil not just its reserves of about N trillion cubic feet of natural gas and N million barrels of oil but also its pipeline <unk> and <unk> operations 
 some speculate that mr. corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price 
 the problem is that mr. icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring usx than mr. corry had planned 
 unlike his predecessor who saw steel as america 's <unk> mr. corry tends to view it as a <unk> and <unk> business with limited potential associates say 
 he has never met lynn williams the president of the united steelworkers union and is n't active in the industry 's main trade group the american iron and steel institute which mr. roderick served as chairman 
 dave thought the country needed a strong u.s. steel and while chuck agreed he was more apt to say not at any cost to shareholders a former executive says 
 as mr. roderick once said we 're a <unk> company and boy if you ca n't figure out the value of those two parts you are so damn <unk> that you do n't belong on wall street 
 about the only way that usx now can get out of steel is to <unk> it out piece by piece in separate joint ventures he adds 
 with mr. icahn breathing down his neck however mr. corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price even if it means losing some <unk> tax-loss <unk> 
 indeed when the bush administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions <unk> the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years mr. corry and his directors were aboard <unk> high above marathon 's rich oil reserves in the north sea 
 however even usx executives who work closely with him are n't sure about his long-term goals 
 i do n't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go one says 
 right now the executive adds he wants to continue to focus on paying down usx 's debt by selling assets 
 one thing is certain however mr. corry while studying other options probably wo n't make a major move until he 's clear about mr. icahn 's intentions 
 and then he wo n't panic says j. bruce johnston a former usx executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with <unk> cohen & <unk> in pittsburgh 
 mr. corry learned presence under fire when as vice president of corporate planning he handled what mr. johnston calls <unk> negotiations that led to usx 's shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction 
 when negotiating mr. corry played his cards close to the <unk>

 but a spokesman said the quake wo n't have as big a financial impact on <unk> as hurricane hugo did

 that is in part because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding she said 
 the buy-back is really a comfort to those who want to buy the stock that there is a price floor he said

 he was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial

 along the way we 're introduced to the supporting cast a <unk> <unk> secretary <unk> <unk> her real name honest a <unk> young boss <unk> <unk> another <unk> <unk> who 's also an <unk> lawyer <unk> <unk> and a <unk> expert charles <unk> 
 in last week 's rape case for example the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest and the biggest <unk> are the politicians who exploit the case 
 what makes the veteran fbi man so <unk> is his <unk> <unk> earned we discover when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s 
 he was n't protecting the freedom <unk> he was <unk> them as <unk>

 at the core of mr. <unk> 's mancuso is his <unk> <unk> 
 he describes a reporter as miss first amendment 
 he describes a <unk> <unk> as <unk> williams 
 and when he 's told try a little <unk> he <unk> back i 'm going home to try a little <unk> 
 yet for all his <unk> he 's at heart a <unk> <unk> a <unk> with a secret crush on truth justice and the american way 
 he 's the kind of guy who <unk> <unk> flags 
 at least once mancuso 's boss <unk> in here now and proceeds to dress his investigator down 
 finally of course the boss gives in but he 's still <unk> i find myself explaining anything to teddy kennedy you 'll be chasing stolen cars in <unk> 
 witnesses <unk> <unk> <unk> a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the <unk> <unk> creatures who try to <unk> down every decent man who raises his voice 
 and mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his <unk> how the hell can you live with yourself he <unk> at a politician 
 why when a key witness disappears does mancuso trash her apartment <unk> down <unk> <unk> walls

 texaco acquired <unk> before it completed those sales because <unk> 's properties are high quality and near other fields texaco already owns a company spokeswoman said 
 mr. icahn who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company sold his stake in texaco just last summer 
 actually <unk> borrowed that quote from a writer of some N centuries earlier israel 's king <unk> wrote those words in the book of <unk> N 
 but he estimated that a raider would have been able to <unk> no more than N N of the shares in recent months 
 they have all very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of ag he said 
 a generale spokesman confirmed that the giant belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in ag should a raider seek control 
 he was all too aware of how a large <unk> <unk> nsc staff had spun out of control and nearly <unk> president reagan 's second term

 but the size shape and role of the nsc staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide 
 he had just resigned at least in part because of a <unk> with assistant secretary of state bernard <unk> over the administration 's policy on panama and support for nicaragua 's contra rebels 
 both gen. scowcroft and his deputy robert gates are experts in u.s.-soviet affairs 
 gen. scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that nsc staffers working in relative <unk> will take over <unk> and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced state department and pentagon bureaus 
 a former sperry corp. marketing executive admitting his role in the pentagon procurement scandal pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping <unk> $ N to a <unk> navy acquisition official during the early 1980s

 he talked about it in every speech he made as he <unk> the country promoting his books which <unk> handy <unk> advice on using government information for fun and profit 
 mr. lesko figured he would be flooded with <unk> by now 
 after all he says we 've got like N million bureaucrats 
 and in addition to the $ N he has promised the winner a my favorite bureaucrat <unk> and offered each of two <unk> $ N 
 to make matters worse the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat a woman from the new york state department of taxation and finance who <unk> her boss 
 mr. lesko who is making the rules as he goes has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats 
 but he says he would prefer to get <unk> from <unk> folks 
 he admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest 
 newspapers including this one have generally ignored his news releases 
 people hate to write he says 
 if he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat <unk> something mr. lesko admits i 'd get N <unk>

 the crowd <unk> mr. jones <unk> his head the cowboys lose the game 
 a few days after that sept. N game mr. <unk> broke a finger <unk> him for weeks 
 for mr. jones losing his <unk> temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has <unk> the dallas cowboys and this year much of the national football league 
 at the very least mr. jones who <unk> the society circuit as <unk> as his bench can take comfort in one fact these days he is n't alone 
 shortly after buying N N of the team from <unk> <unk> bright for $ N million and <unk> of the cowboys ' <unk> bottom line the <unk> mr. jones set about his own round of team cuts 
 first he <unk> <unk> tom <unk> the legendary coach who took the cowboys to five <unk> <unk> and N consecutive winning seasons 
 <unk> sentiment flooded the local press a crude <unk> <unk> said one writer a real <unk> said another who in the hell does he think he is wrote a third 
 he quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half shut down a <unk> dance academy and in july announced plans to sell valley ranch the team 's <unk> practice camp and the most <unk> training facility in the nfl 
 he likes to tell the <unk> of how he got lost on the <unk> ranch during an early visit took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help 
 it 's just not cost efficient he says 
 when he sells it he says the cowboys will move to a more practical read affordable <unk> practice field near texas stadium 
 and as for tom <unk> well in mr. jones 's mind he had played out his winning years 
 after posting losing seasons in each of the last three years the cowboys needed a change he says 
 an arkansas native he started at guard on the <unk> N university of arkansas team that won a national championship 
 after college he worked at his father 's insurance company in little rock and in N led an aborted attempt to buy the san diego <unk> 
 years later with cash from the sale of the insurance company he founded <unk> production corp. an oil and gas exploration company based in little rock 
 so it was n't surprising that mr. jones returned to his arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for mr. <unk> 
 he tapped <unk> johnson a <unk> on the N university of arkansas <unk> and the head coach at the university of miami where he led the <unk> to five winning seasons and a national championship in N

 to try to draw more fans he has dropped <unk> ticket prices from $ N to $ N 
 mr. jones has also <unk> up his marketing staff to sell the N luxury suites <unk> texas stadium his deal with <unk> bright included operating rights for the stadium 
 the sales job seems to be paying off when he bought the team only six of the suites had been sold 
 he is also trying to get more stations in mexico where the cowboys have a following to pick up the games 
 mr. jones whose <unk> voice and <unk> ways <unk> an intense businessman who works <unk> days is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days 
 he calls the contracts critical to winning in the nfl and has played his part in the bidding wars 
 details of the plan which would go into effect in N are <unk> but each player would apparently be paid a base salary <unk> to his position and ability 
 when the lease expires in N he says it 's got to be changed 
 an nfl spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable tv companies like espn 
 for his part jerry jones says he 's in the business for the long haul and his work style seems to support that 
 he puts in busy <unk> weeks excluding game days and on one recent afternoon <unk> questions in the course of an hour from a tv producer his <unk> marketing manager a <unk> customer and a <unk> of arkansas reporters 
 to keep his schedule on track he flies two personal secretaries in from little rock to <unk> his staff in dallas 
 when i made this investment i made it on a lifetime basis he explains 
 besides to a large extent mr. jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team even though it keeps losing 
 owning the cowboys has bought him <unk> to a <unk> life that drilling for oil in arkansas just did n't provide 
 a few weeks ago mr. jones even <unk> elizabeth taylor in his private <unk> at texas stadium 
 you 're in the <unk> seat every day in this job he says

 mr. bush asked congress to raise to $ N billion from $ N billion the amount of money defense secretary dick cheney may shift among the pentagon 's individual programs projects and activities allowing him to ease the pain that the gramm-rudman budget law was intended to <unk>
